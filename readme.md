# Computational Biology and Bioinformatics DevContainer for VSCode

This repository provides a Visual Studio Code development container specifically tailored for computational biology and bioinformatics research. The container includes two primary environments:

- **Python Environment (`py_env`)**: This environment is equipped with CUDA support, making it ideal for handling computations that benefit from GPU acceleration.
- **R Environment (`r_env`)**: This environment includes RStudio Server, providing a robust platform for statistical computing and graphics.

## Features

- **CUDA Integration**: Accelerate your data processing and model training with the power of GPU computing.
- **RStudio Server**: Access a powerful IDE for R, directly within your development environment, enhancing productivity and collaboration.

## Getting Started

To use this devcontainer, ensure that you have Visual Studio Code and the Remote - Containers extension installed. Clone this repository and open it in VSCode. Then, follow the prompt to reopen the project in the containerized environment, allowing you to access pre-configured settings and tools for your research.
